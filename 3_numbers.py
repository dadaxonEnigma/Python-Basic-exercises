# 1. You have a football field that is 92 meter long and 48.8 meter wide. Find out total
#    area using python and print it
# length = 92
# width = 48.8
# square = round(length * width,2)
# print(square)

# 2. You bought 9 packets of potato chips from a store. Each packet costs 1.49 dollar
#    and you gave shopkeeper 20 dollar.
#    Find out using python, how many dollars is the shopkeeper going to give you back?
# potatoes = 1.49
# ret_money = 20 - (9 * potatoes)
# print(ret_money) 

# 3. You want to replace tiles in your bathroom which is exactly square and 5.5 feet
#    is its length. If tiles cost 500 rs per square feet, how much will be the total
#    cost to replace all tiles. Calculate and print the cost using python
#    Hint: Use power operator (**) to find area of a square
# length = 5.5
# area = length**2
# cost = area * 500
# print(cost)

# 4. Print binary representation of number 17
# num = 17
# print('Binary of number 17 is:', format(num,'b'))
